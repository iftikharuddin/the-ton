## Ton accounts, tokens and transactions

TON Accounts ARE Smart Contracts. Unlike Ethereum where address comes directly from public key. In TON -> Address comes from smart contract code + your public key

- TON Address Security:
  Unlike ETH, TON addresses are smart contract addresses that need deployment
  
  Same account = multiple formats (bounceable/non-bounceable)
  
  Address confusion attacks possible! Always validate format + workchain
  
  Complexity = New attack surface!
